    # This script by romanktv, creator of PowerLevel10k,  has a script
    # that pre-paints your prompt while your shell is loading, giving
    # the impression that it's already loaded.
    # See: https://gist.github.com/romkatv/8b318a610dc302bdbe1487bb1847ad99
    #
    # Currently, the majority of time slowing down the shell init is
    # spent in compdump, compinit, compdef and compaudit.
    # Man for compinit here talks about how to speed up compinit.
    # The -C option skips checks for new completions
    # See: https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Completion-System.html
    #
    # In our shell, compinit is called by marlonrichert/zsh-autocomplete.
    # zsh-autocomplete can accept arguments to compinit:
    # https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-autocomplete?tab=readme-ov-file#pass-arguments-to-compinit
    #
    # This script shows a technique that passes the -C arg to compinit unless
    # a .zcompdump file is detected that's less than 24 hours old.
    # See: https://gist.github.com/ctechols/ca1035271ad134841284#gistcomment-2308206
    #
    # We could create a script that conditionally sets zstyle to pass compinit
    # args for zsh-autocomplete with the same logic.
    #
    # A more comprehensive solution, though, is to find out why compinit is dumping
    # completions every time we init shell, even though .zcompdump has already been created.
    #
    # Does the -C argument even result in a speedup?
    #
    # zsh-bench can be used to measure shell responsiveness times.

    #
    # We should take a look with zprof, to figure out whether duplicate calls to compinit
    # are being made, and why the .zcompdump cache is being busted every time.
    #
    # It looks like 1 call to compinit with 976 calls to compdef, so we're not duping calls.
    #
    # The list of known completions is stored in the associative array _comps.
    # From: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40010848/how-to-list-all-zsh-autocompletions
    # The following script can list all completions: ./list-completions.sh
    #
    # zsh's built-in list of completions can be found here...
    # See: https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh/tree/master/Completion/Unix/Command
    #
    # Additional completions can be found here...
    # See: https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions
    #
    # As per: https://mikebian.co/git-completions-tooling-on-the-command-line/
    # - You can see the full completion mapping in ~/.zcompdump
    # - You can uninstall completions within a shell session by removing them from the _comp variable, or by removing the completion file in $fpath
    # - You can find a completionâ€™s location using fd '_git$' $fpath
    # This link has a lot of good tips.
    #
    # In this StackExchange article complaining of slow zsh startups, the author loads 800+
    # completions from compdef in a 10th of the speed.
    #
    # This suggests something's wrong with compinit, for it to be taking so long.
    #
    # More speed suggestions here: https://scottspence.com/posts/speeding-up-my-zsh-shell
    #
    # I did get one super fast compinit after playing with the extra compinit -C below
    #
    # It's possible zsh-autocomplete isn't calling compinit. Disabling it to see if something else is calling it.
    # It's not zsh-autocomplete that's doing it.
    #
    # It's likely nix or oh-my-zsh, and it's doing it before completion plugins are loaded.
    # Also good advice here: https://dev.to/djmoch/zsh-compinit--rtfm-47kg
    #
    # It's oh-my-zsh that's running compinit, but without zsh-autocomplete it's instant.
    # Also, disabling omz removes the call to compinit.
    #
    # It's zsh-autocomplete that's slowing down the compinit call.
    #
    # Must be that's just the way it is, because it does a lot of work.
    # Probably, a better alternative to home-manager is to symlink dotfiles,
    # and use 'znap' again to set up starship / oh-my-zsh etc as per this example:
    # https://github.com/marlonrichert/zsh-snap/blob/main/.zshrc
    #
    # znap loads shell plugins asynchronously and compile / evals them to speed up shell init.
    # Let's try to get a set up working with znap, and load the ssh-agent omz plugins.

    # Uncomment this to run the shell profile
    # to identify what's slowing down shell initialisation
